  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I’m a french college student studying IT and networks.</p>

<p>I started taking a real interest in computer security quite recently, but I’ve always been attracted by computers and technology. The first thing that grabbed me into this world was video games, then I discovered programming and became fascinated by the creative power it provided. The funny thing is that now, I spend most of my time trying to break codes instead of creating them.</p>

<p>I don’t set the focus on a specific aspect of cybersecurity because i’m interested in all of them: from cryptography to reverse engineering and forensics, web, steganography, …</p>

<p>When I started learning hacking, I found a lot of online contents and books but websites like <a href="https://root-me.org">Root-Me</a> or <a href="https://newbiecontest.org">Newbie Contest</a> are for me the greatest tools.
They provide a rich playground as long as lots of useful documentations.</p>

<p>What I’d like to do with this blog is to explain some basics of Computer Security in the context of Capture The Flag contests. I’ll post here detailed write-ups of challenges I found interesting in the CTFs I’ve done.</p>

<p>The articles will be intended for beginners so I’ll try to be very explicit and, of course, do not hesitate to contact me for any inquiry.</p>
