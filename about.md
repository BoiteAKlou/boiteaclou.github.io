I'm a french college student studying IT and networks.
I started taking a real interest in computer security quite recently so I still have a lot to learn.
I don't really have a main discipline so I'm interested in every field related with security.
This blog is for me a place to publish CTF write-ups and articles that will allow me to widen my skills while sharing useful (I hope ;-)) resources for beginners.
