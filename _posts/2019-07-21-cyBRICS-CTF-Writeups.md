## [Web] Warmup

>Just get the [flag](http://45.32.148.106/)


### Resolution

When browsing to the link in the sentence, we were instantly redirected to **/final.html**, which displays a very long text but no flag.

Using Burpsuite, we could intercept the redirection and grab the flag lcoated in **/index.html**.

![Warmup flag]({{ "/assets/2019-07-21/warmup-flag.png" | absolute_url }} "Warmup flag")

Once base64-decoded, we could read the following flag: `cybrics{4b646c7985fec6189dadf8822955b034}`.

### Resolution

I'm pretty sure I didn't solve this challenge the intended way because my method was pretty dumb. Judge by yourself! :wink:

After registering an account, you were greeted with the following php page:

![Bitkoff home]({{ "/assets/2019-07-21/bitkoff-home.png" | absolute_url }} "Bitkoff home")

Everytime you clicked on "MINE BTC", `0.0000000001` was added to your BTC counter. It was, then, possible to **convert BTC to USD** in order to **buy the flag when you reached 1$**.

An auto-miner costed 0.01$ and would click for you every second... not so worth it.

What I did is pretty simple: I've **automated the mining request** thanks to a python script and ran 6 instances of it in parallel until I got enough BTC to buy the flag. Absolutely nothing was optimized but I had a few other things to do so I've left the script run in background for approximately 2 hours and I could buy the flag!

```python
import requests,re

payload = {'mine': '1'}
cook = {'name' : 'boiteaklou', 'password' : 'boiteaklou'}

while 1:
    r = requests.post('http://95.179.148.72:8083/index.php',data=payload,cookies=cook)
    btc = re.findall('Your BTC: <b>([^<]*)</b>',r.text)
    print("BTC: %s"%btc[0])
```

Here is the cheapest bitcoin mining farm ever:

![Mining farm]({{ "/assets/2019-07-21/bitkoff-farm.png" | absolute_url }} "Mining farm")

A minor difficulty consisted in the fact that we could not enter a value lower than 0.0001 in the change field because of some HTML client-side check. However, we could forge the request using Burpsuite and it worked like a charm.

![Bitkoff 1 dollar]({{ "/assets/2019-07-21/bitkoff-one_dollar.png" | absolute_url }} "Bitkoff 1$")

And the flag:

![Bitkoff flag]({{ "/assets/2019-07-21/bitkoff-flag.png" | absolute_url }} "Bitkoff flag")

`flag: cybrics{50_57R4n93_pR3c1510n}`

## [Web] Caesaref

### Resolution

After register a new account, we were greeted with the following web page where we could ask questions to the support:

![Caesaref home]({{ "/assets/2019-07-21/caesaref-home.png" | absolute_url }} "Caesaref home")

At first, I lost a lot of time trying to redirect the support guy to my website via XSS payloads like `<img src="http://mywebsite" />`.

Actually, it was not necessary. We only had to paste an HTTP link in the text box and a bot would visit it instantly.

Using this information, we could **paste the link to a webhook instance** and surprisingly find the **PHPSESSID cookie of the bot** sent with the request.

![Caesaref request]({{ "/assets/2019-07-21/caesaref-request.png" | absolute_url }} "Caesaref request")

Then, we could replace our own PHPSESSID cookie by the retrieved one and refresh the page in order to access the bot account. Once connected, a new button was here to give us the flag.

`Flag: cybrics{k4Ch3_C4N_83_vuln3R48l3}`

### Resolution

The given text file shows a SMTP trace from which we could extract some credentials as well as the password of an archive.

A NMAP scan showed us that the pop3 port (tcp 110) was open so we could connect to it and authentify ourselves using the retrieved credentials.

Then, we could extract the content of the retrieved archive using the previously found password: `7z e -pcrack0Weston88vertebra archive.zip`

And we could finally read the flag inside the extracted PDF: `cybrics{Y0uV3_G0T_m41L}`.

### Resolution

The zip archive contained a pcap that I opened in Wireshark. Since the capture was quite big, I used **Statistics > Protocol Hierarchy** in order to get the big picture.

The packet capture was composed of **802.11 traffic** and thanks to the protocol hierarchy, I could spot some **HTTP requests**.

As the statement was mentioning a password change, I decided to examine **HTTP POST requests** only thanks to the wireshark filter: `http.request.method == "POST"`.

Inside the payload of HTTP POST request nÂ°19173, we could find `WLAN_AP_WEP_KEY1=Xi1nvy5KGSgI2&`. Then, I added this wep key to **wireshark decryption keys** and it allowed us to find more HTTP requests.

Still filtering HTTP POST requests, I found a new password change request with this payload: `WLAN_AP_WPA_PSK=2_RGR_xO-uiJFiAxdA33-PsdanuK&` that I immediately set as **WPA decryption key**.

Once again, we had access to more decrypted HTTP traffic inside which the flag was located.

### Resolution

After connecting to the machine via SSH, we were trapped inside **a SWI-Prolog interactive interpreter**. We could verify this assumption by pressing TAB twice, which would display the list of available functions.

```bash
$ ssh pro@95.179.148.72

$ cat flag.txt

### Resolution

This challenge was very easy but a bit painful for my eyes because I solved it late in the night.

The idea is to **compare the clear and the encoded output** in order to **establish a match for each character**.

Using this technique and a tiny bit of guessing (because it's stega), I could build the following matching table and reconstruct the flag.

```
240C : c
< : y
2409 : b
23BC : r
240B : i
23BD : s
Pi : {
2424 : h
half-T : l
23BB : p
Cross : n
low T : w
|- : t
Pound : }
grey square : a
```

`cybrics{h0ly_cr4p_1s_this_al13ni$h_0r_w4t?}`


The CTF was pretty fun, thanks CyBRICS for the event!
